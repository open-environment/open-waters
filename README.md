# Open Waters

## What is Open Waters?
Open Waters is a web-based water quality data management system that allows you to manage water quality monitoring locations, samples, results, and projects. The intended audience is tribal, state, or local volunteer water quality data managers, who collect and manage water quality data, and have the need to submit this data to EPA's WQX program. Open Waters is unique in that people can manage their data locally, but submission to EPA is completely automated and handled behind-the-scenes, thus eliminating the burden of separate data submission to EPA. Plus, it is free and completely open source.

* Security: Role-based application security and additional layered security measures to ensure data security
* Multi-Organization Support: Support multiple agencies to share the application; all data is segmented by Organization.
